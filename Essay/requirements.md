What the assignment aims to do:
- follow up on a topic of particular interest
- gain familiarity with the scientific literature on software engineering
- gain practice at distilling the main points in a way that can be disseminated to others

What to do to do the assignment:
- select two papers from the scientific literature on a topic related either to Software Requirements or to Software Design
- Summarise main contributions in 1000 words
- Papers present a sequence (time, development, changes in tackling a problem)

The papers must be published in recognised peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings or books. Web sites other than refereed journal and conference archives are not acceptable. At least one of the papers must have been published in the last 10 years (2005 or later).
