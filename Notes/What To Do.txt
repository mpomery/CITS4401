Design and Implement Swimming Pool Automated Checking System (SPAC)
  - It assists in keeping private pools maintained
  - Design with use over internet in mind
    - Can run locally for testing
  - Implement in Java, C, C++ or Python
  - Web Admin Interface

What is SPACS
  - Manage Collection and Analysis of measurements from pools
  - Pools are registered by local pool shops
  - Data from pool automatically entered by Pool Testing Units (PTUs)
    - Via Web
  - 

Data From The PTU
  - Date/Time
  - pH (acidity)
  - ORP (chlorine level)
  - TA (total alkalinity)
  - Temperature
  - Water Hardness level
  - date/time of last filter operation
  - Water Flow Rate through filter
  - Chlorinator Status
  - Water Level Status
  - Alarms
    - Water Level Too Low
    - pumps fail to operate
  - Measurements should fall within a recommended and a safe range
    - Alert if outside recommended range
      - Action within a month
    - Warning if outside safe
      - No use until resolved

Actors
  - Global Admin
  - Local Pool Shops
  - Pool Testing Units (PTUs)
