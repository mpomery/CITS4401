There can be multiple administrators in the SPACS system that manage all the PoolShops. Each PoolOwner can only be registered at one PoolShop, and each PoolTestingUnit can only be linked to one PoolOwner. The Administrator, PoolShop and PoolOwner objects all contain information about a single person.
